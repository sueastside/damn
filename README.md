About
-----
DAMN is more granular than your run-of-the-mill DMS, it tracks 'assets' within 'files' rather than just the 'files' themselfs. This allows for example to assign a task to a specific mesh with a Blender file, without the overhead of having to specify which mesh in the task's description.

DAMN Refactor
-------------
DAMN has now been split up in several modules:
 
 * DAMN-AT: DAMN's Analyzers and Transcoders framework, the now stand-alone heart of DAMN.
 * DAMN-index: ElasticSearch based indexing for the extracted meta-data.
 * DAMN-rest: The REST-api wrapper around all of DAMN's services.
 * DAMN-UI: the UI that pull it all together.
